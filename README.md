# 2D Kinematics Simulator
A simple simulation of an object flying out of a cannon at a specified velocity and angle

## Running the software (or appending more)
I reccomend using python virtual enviroments  
```python -m venv 'YOUR NAME CHOICE'```  
Then navigate to the "Scripts" directory and run either "Activate.ps1" or "activate.bat". Now that it's a virtual enviroment the project requries Pygame, so:  
```pip install pygame```

## Scope of the Project
1. Variable inital velocity
2. Variable launch angle
3. Movement of object across the screen
4. Charting of flight path
